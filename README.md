I build things.  
Some work. Some teach lessons.

---

## ⛓️
- Systems, networks, patterns  
- Things that repeat shouldn’t be manual  
- Curiosity > comfort  
- Learning in public, thinking in private  

---

## ⚙️
- Windows / Linux  
- Networks that talk, packets that don’t lie  
- Tools that scan, listen, automate  
- Scripts that exist because they had to

## 🧩 Projects

- **Packet Dreams**  
  Traffic patterns recorded, replayed, and questioned.  

- **Silent Handshake**  
  Trust confirmed without announcing itself.  

- **Things That Should’ve Been Automated**  
  A growing collection. None asked politely.  

- **False Positives**  
  Signals that looked dangerous. Some were.  

- **Stateful**  
  Remembered too much for too long. Reset helped.  

- **Config Graveyard**  
  Working configurations. Abandoned anyway.  

- **Entropy Notes**  
  Observations written while things were breaking.  

- **The Last Manual Step**  
  Removed once. Returned quietly.  

- **Unlabeled Ports**  
  Services running where they shouldn’t be.  

- **Midnight Scripts**  
  Written late. Trusted early. Regretted occasionally.
